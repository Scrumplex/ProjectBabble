# ProjectBabble
A Mouth tracking system for VR, 100% Opensource!

Currently the architecture is a modified efficientnetv2-b0 training on blenshapes from ARKit! The model outputs 31 blenshapes of which most cross over with SRanipals blendshapes.

### One thing to note
1. This model is not a 1 to 1 translation to SRanipal blenshapes. While most blendshapes do cross over with SRanipal cheek and tounge movements are limited.

### How to run
Go to the releases tab, download the latest exe. Clone this repo, and then move the calibration file (calib.json) to the same location as the exe. Next get the .onnx model in the repo and move it to the same location as the exe. Run the exe and enjoy!

### PLEASE HIT THE TURN OFF CALIBRATION BUTTON UNTILL FURTHER NOTICE
It ruins the model's quality 

### Warranty
Lol
